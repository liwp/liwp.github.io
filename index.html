  <p>
    Hi! I'm Lauri Pesonen and I'm a software consultant who helps innovative
    technology companies adopt Amazon's AWS Lambda as their application backend.
  </p>

  <p>
    AWS Lambda offers a number of advantages:
    <ul>
      <li>automatic scalability</li>
      <li>pay only for actual use</li>
      <li>pain-free integration with other Amazon services</li>
      <li>generous free tier</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    I can help you design and implement an AWS Lambda -based backend for your
    application. I can also review your existing backend and offer guidance on
    how to migrate it to AWS Lambda.
